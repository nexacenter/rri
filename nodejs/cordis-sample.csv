It has the potential to deliver significant cost savings to the healthcare system, and direct more appropriate utilization of healthcare resources. This will be achieved via a patient-centric holistic approach that specifically addresses the above barriers. PATHway will provide individualized rehabilitation programs that use regular, socially inclusive exercise sessions as the basis upon which to provide a personalized, comprehensive lifestyle intervention program (managing exercise/physical activity (PA), smoking, diet, stress management, alcohol use etc.) to enable patients to both better understand and deal with their own condition and to lead a healthier lifestyle in general. This will be made possible by the provision of an internet- enabled, sensor-based home exercise platform that allows remote participation in CR exercise programs at any time, either by one-self or by a small number of patients, from the comfort of their own living room.

Cardiovascular disease collectively refers to diseases of the heart and circulatory system including coronary artery disease (CAD) and congenital heart disease (CHD). It is the leading cause of premature death (30% of all deaths) and disability in Europe and worldwide (WHO). With changing demographics and deteriorating lifestyle this situation will worsen considerably, which is neither economically or socially sustainable.

Cardiac Rehabilitation is a secondary prevention programme with exercise, which includes an educational programme on healthy lifestyle (dietary habits, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption and learning to manage stress).

There are generally three phases of CR:

Phase I is in-hospital education;
Phase II is very structured and begins after leaving hospital with out-patient return visits 2-3 times/week for supervised exercise training and education sessions;
Phase III requires the patient to self-manage their rehabilitation.
However, patient CR uptake and adherence are very low across member states, especially for phase III: approximately 11% of eligible patients begin a long-term phase III community-based CR programme.

PATHway will target individuals entering Phase III as this is where large numbers of patients, who would benefit significantly from exercise and CR, drop out.

Increased PA alone reduces all-cause mortality by 24% and provides considerable protection from cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities, leading to longer independent living and a lower use of health care resources.

Providing CR interventions in the home the patient is allowed to use at any time in a comfortable and personal environment PATHway system. In addition, there are clear benefits to all members of the health eco-system to move away from a healthcare provider-centric system to a co-production model, which empowering patients to self-manage their CVD has been shown to further enhance improvements in health and quality of life associated with a home-based CR programme.",Integrity Science Driven,"Research that makes false claims, either in terms of what the developed technology developed will be able to or can do, or what the technology's effect on human health will be/is. It is also addressing a problem that is already resolved without clearly acknowledging the extent of that science and without accurately stating how the extent to which the new science will go beyond the current state-of-the-art.

In addition, given the emphasis under public funding schemes (such as H2020) on the aim of job and knowledge creation, irresponsible research does not take this seriously and simply pays lip-service to it.

Finally, it is misappropriation of fees.","It relates to integrity of the claims it will make n terms of what our developed technology will be able to do, and what the technology's effect on cardiac rehabilitation will be. 

It is also relates to accurately stating the current state-of-the-art and the extent to which we will go beyond this .

WeLive aims to develop an innovative and open technological framework to involve citizens, public administrations (P.A.) and local businesses and companies into the innovation process. Specifically, the WeLive will enable:

Citizens, companies and public administration to express their needs and elaborate new ideas for services and apps and to choose the most promising ones;
Companies to develop basic building blocks that emerge from the needs expressed by the selected ideas;
Public Administration and Citizens (final users) to release open data that emerge from the needs expressed by the selected ideas;
Citizens and P.A. to fund companies to transform popular ideas into Applications, using the building blocks (open service and open data) available in the marketplace.
Objectives are broken down into smaller Societal (SO) and technological (TO) objectives.
To promote the economic growth and job creation with added-value vertical apps and datasets:
WeLive will offer a set of tools to create and deploy new public services (apps) from open datasets.
To increase transparency and trust in public administrationsthrough new datasets and apps:
New datasets will be transformed and adapted through WeLive’s Open Data Toolset component given the public access to new information of public interest.
To provide holistic support for the Open Innovation process of public services:
WeLive wants to open public service innovation to any stakeholder within a municipality. Citizens, local businesses and companies can collaborate during several phases of public service delivery, e.g. design,  execution and monitoring by generating new public service ideas, voting, selecting and funding them as well as by taking part in implementing and promoting new services.
To streamline the exploitation of Open Data from public services:
WeLive wants to enable access to the Broad Data gathered within a city coming from different heterogeneous sources such as Open Government Data repositories, user-supplied data through social networks or apps, public private sector data or end-user private data which can be used to filter and recommend the contents and services most relevant to them. For that, it provides the Open Data Toolset and the Citizen Data Vault components.
To democratize creation of novel public services:
WeLive provides an open collaboration platform for public administrations where basic services around the data belonging to the councils and even basic services accessing data external to the councils can be seamlessly combined by any stakeholder, ranging from public administration staff, passing by software developers to end citizens.

Millions of people struggle to communicate in noisy environments particularly the elderly: 7% of the European population are classified as hearing impaired. Hearing aids can effectively deal with a simple loss in sensitivity, but they do not restore the ability of a healthy pair of young ears to pick out a weak voice among many, that is needed for effective social communication. That is the need. The opportunity is that decisive technological progress has been made in the area of acoustic scene analysis: arrays of microphones and beamforming algorithms, or distributed networks of handheld devices such as smart phones can be recruited to vastly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of weak sound sources. Some of these techniques have been around for a while, and are even integrated within commercially available hearing aids. However their uptake is limited for one very simple reason: there is no easy way to steer the device, no way to tell it to direct the processing to the one source among many that the user wishes to attend to. The COCOHA project proposes to use brain signals (EEG) to help steer the acoustic scene analysis hardware, in effect extending the efferent neural pathways that control all stages of processing from cortex down to the cochlea, to govern also the external device. To succeed we must overcome major technical hurdles, drawing on methods from acoustic signal processing and machine learning borrowed from the field of Brain Computer Interfaces.

Our heterogeneous system consists of 3 different agent types:
On the sea-ground, artificial mussels are the collective long-term memory of the system, allowing information to stay beyond the runtime of other agents, thus allowing to continue learning from previously learned states. These mussels monitor the natural habitat, including biological agents like algae, bacterial incrustation and fish.
On the water surface, artificial lily pads interface with the human society, delivering energy and information influx from ship traffic or satellite data.
Between those two layers, artificial fish move/monitor/explore the environment and exchange info with the mussels and lily pads. Artificial mussels are novel class of underwater agents.
We aim to push forward the edge of knowledge with novel sensors (electric sense/electro-communication), novel bio-inspired algorithms (underwater hives) and novel energy harvesting in underwater scenarios.
We will improve the world’s record for swarm-size in autonomous collective underwater robotics by almost one order of magnitude.
Our application field is a human- and animal-co-inhabited real-world environment of high impact: Venice canals & lagoon.
These habitats are highly dynamic and structured, expected to be reflected by a spatial self-structuring of our mussel population.
These sub-populations locally perform memetic or cultural learning algorithms on their specific local data. Thus our cultural evolution algorithms will promote sub-culture development, similar to the human society that does the same above the water level in parallel.

However, the majority of multifunctional water sensors only supports predefined goals hindering interoperability, with a high cost, impeding large scale deployments.
Approach: Addressing this, PROTEUS aims at offering x10 reduction in both size and unit function cost compared to state of the art. To this end, an increased number of functions will be integrated at a reduced cost and PROTEUS will deliver a reconfigurable microfluidic-and nano-enabled sensor platform for cognitive water quality monitoring. Innovative embedded software will provide reconfigurability of the sensing board to support several differentiated applicative goals while cognitive capabilities will manage evolving requirements during exploitation. Energy autonomy will be made by harvesting water flow energy. In addition, low cost of additional sensing components will enable redundancy increasing life span of the systems.
The main challenge relates to the heterogeneous integration into a monolithic, microfluidic sensing chip of carbon nanotubes-based resistive chemical sensors, of MEMS physical and rheological resistive sensors and of a multifunctional adaptive deep-submicron CMOS system on chip.
Upstream, high level system design addressing industrial use cases, manufacturability and cost-effectiveness, packaging, energy budget and interfaces between building blocks, will enable consistency and efficiency of the whole approach.
Downstream, system validation will be carried out at different levels: benchmarking, reliability assessment to guarantee service time, model deployments and field testing.

They could open up tremendous potential to measure behaviour indicators that heretofore resisted measurement because they were too subtle or fleeting to be measured by the human eye and ear, would effectively lead to development of the next generation of efficient, seamless and user-centric human-computer interaction (affective multimodal interfaces, interactive multi-party games, and online services), would have profound impact on business (automatic market research analysis would become possible, recruitment would become green as travels would be reduced drastically), would enable next generation healthcare technologies (remote monitoring of conditions like pain, anxiety and depression), to mention but a few examples.
The overall aim of the SEWA project is to enable such technology, i.e., to capitalise on existing state-of- the-art methodologies, models and algorithms for machine analysis of facial, vocal and verbal behaviour, and then adjust and combine them to realise naturalistic human-centric human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-mediated face-to-face interaction (FF-HCI) for data recorded by a device as cheap as a web-cam and in almost arbitrary recording conditions including semi-dark, dark and noisy rooms with dynamic change of room impulse response and distance to sensors. This extends and contrasts considerably the current state of the art in existing technological solutions to machine analysis of the facial, vocal and verbal behaviour that are used in (commercially and otherwise) available human-centric HCI and FF-HCI applications.
To wit, shortcomings of existing technologies for automatic analysis of human behaviour are numerous.
Current studies have been largely conducted in laboratory conditions so far with controlled noise level, reverberation, often limited verbal content, illumination, calibrated cameras, and subjects who are instructed not to eat or talk on the phone while being recorded. Such conditions are very difficult to reproduce in real-world applications and tools trained on such data usually do not generalise well to behavioural recordings made in the wild (in unconstrained settings typical for HCI and FF-HCI scenarios).
Interpretation of facial and vocal behaviour depends crucially on the dynamics of the behaviour (timing, velocity, frequency, temporal inter-dependencies between gestures), which is currently not taken into account.
Observed behaviours may be influenced by those of an interlocutor and thus require analysis of both interactants, especially to measure such critically important patterns as mimicry, rapport, and sentiment, in general, but this is not currently taken into account. Existing approaches typically perform analysis of a single individual and FF-HCI is not addressed as a problem of simultaneous analysis of both interacting parties.
The main aim of the SEWA project is to address these shortcomings of the current HCI and FF-HCI technology and develop novel, robust technology for machine analysis of facial, vocal and verbal behaviour in the wild as shown by a single person or by two (or more) interactants.
As a proof of concept, and with the focus on novel HCI and FF-HCI applications, SEWA technology will be applied to:
machine inference of sentiment/ liking ratings in response to multimedia content (movie trailers, product adverts, etc.) watched by people in the wild, based on which a multimedia recommender system will be built, offering to the user multimedia content being similar to that she liked previously;
automatic estimation of sentiment, rapport and empathy shown by two people involved in unscripted computer-mediated dyadic interaction (using an online video chat service like opentok), based on which Chat Roulette Social Game will be developed that tries to find out people with whom one would like to chat (the underlying phenomena are the formation and dynamics of clusters of people that like to chat with each other, e.g., have the same opinions about debating issues; based on which formation and dynamics of social media/networks and opinion polls can be studied, and serious games providing depth of learning and participation can be built).","novelty,ethics,deliverable  ",Not following the ethical conduct/erroneous evaluations and analysis of results/late deliverables,good coordination between the project partners / having experts for the target topic of the project / following ethical conduct / timely dissemination of the project findings  ,"Evaluation framework, Tutorials, Webinars"

Many domains in the area of CPS are already in the midst of a global race of repositioning and reinventing themselves by developing new dynamic business models based on CPS.

Today, the trend goes towards open CPS devices and we see a strong request for open platforms, which act as computational basis that can be extended during operation. In this area, we focus on the functional extension provided by Apps, as it is already common for mobile and other consumer devices.
The main goal is to extend and customize CPS devices with new 3rd party services and features in an Apps platform in an efficient, secure and trusted way.

This extensibility is an important differentiator that enables new market extensions to keep pace with user expectations and latest technology. For instance, current Apps for vehicles provide infotainment functionality or control basic settings, both of which are not safety critical.

As the next steps, Apps targeting CPS devices can also use and adapt safety-sensitive functions, a concept which we call CPS Apps. For instance, a sports upgrade package may change the driving behavior of an automotive car, while another App may adapt the vehicle stability control according to road conditions. Other applications may use internal sensors of the car (e.g. perimetric cameras) for other purposes, e.g. to provide a top-level view of the car on the road. Similarly, in the health domain, we typically have vertical solutions for specific treatments. Here, we aim to open these towards multi-purpose devices, where Apps may be installed for specific diagnosis or treatments.
Despite many efforts on trustworthy systems, security attacks become more and more common, especially when easier or more rewarding targets are introduced, such as it is the case for traditional app platform concepts. Hence we do not consider current, complex Apps platforms like iOS and Android as suitable for such CPS Apps, but identify the need for new, more sophisticated and safety proven approaches. For CPS devices, we see further challenges as CPS-based applications often operate in realtime and furthermore have to comply with high safety requirements, and also protect the internal resources such as networks from overload.
To address the above, the TAPPS (Trusted Apps for open CPS) project goes beyond traditional solutions for safety, security and reliability in the CPS domain (acknowledging but superseding projects such as EVITA, OVERSEE and D-MILS) and offers a new approach towards extensibility of CPS platforms, the TAPPS concept. TAPPS is based on a dedicated execution environment for distributed, safety-critical CPS applications offering multiple layers of security and a holistic, open end-to-end tool chain for developing and deploying CPS Apps.
Design, implement and validate a separate, dedicated, realtime Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for highly-trusted CPS Apps. The TEE is located inside the system control units and uses TAPPS’ processor- and network-centric security mechanisms and a hypervisor for virtualization

Arguably, to be “smart everywhere” we will need to have “eyes everywhere”. Coupled with advances in artificial vision, the possibilities are endless in terms of wearable applications, augmented reality, surveillance, ambient-assisted living, etc. Currently, computer vision is rapidly moving beyond academic research and factory automation. On the other hand, mass-market mobile devices owe much of their success to their impressing imaging capabilities, so the question arises if such devices could be used as “eyes everywhere”.

Vision is the most demanding sensor in terms of power consumption and required processing power and, in this respect, existing mass consumer mobile devices have three problems:
1) power consumption precludes their “always-on” capability.
2) they would have unused sensors for most vision-based applications.
3) since they have been designed for a definite purpose (i.e. as cell phones, PDAs and “readers”) people will not consistently use them for other purposes.

Our objective in this project is to build an optimized core vision platform that can work independently and also embedded into all types of artefacts. The envisioned open hardware must be combined with carefully designed APIs that maximize inferred information per milliwatt and adapt the quality of inferred results to each particular application. This will not only mean more hours of continuous operation, it will allow to create novel applications and services that go beyond what current vision systems can do, which are either personal/mobile or “always-on” but not both at the same time.

The MoreGrasp Scenario
Harry, a 39 year old man, has one major passion (besides his professional interest as a construction engineer): he loves to cook. During one of his visits on a construction site, unsecured wooden beams were released from a stack. One of the beams hit him directly on his neck. Fortunately, the rescue chain worked seamlessly. A rescue helicopter transported him to a trauma centre.
One year later, Harry is now wheelchair-bound and returns back home from rehabilitation in professional centres. From the accident one year ago, he suffers from a complete spinal cord injury at the level of the 4th vertebrae. Besides being unable to move his legs, he suffers from autonomous dysfunctions (for example, he cannot control his bladder). Furthermore, he is not able to fully move his elbow and cannot move his fingers to grasp objects.
But there is hope. In the final phase of his clinical stay, Susanne, an occupational therapist, visited him in the hospital. She had learned of Harry’s accident after a caregiver had entered his name and clinical status on the MoreGrasp company website.
Susanne brought a special assistive device to Harry, the neuroprosthesis evaluation kit. This device consists of a functional electrical stimulation unit and a headphone-like headset for brain wave recording. Wearing the headset, Harry performed several tasks, which were displayed on a tablet on his lap. “This is to check your brain rhythms, which we would like to use for control”, Susanne said. After that, she took some self-adhering electrodes and checked the muscle strength in Harry’s forearm to assess finger control and biceps and triceps muscles. “The left arm looks promising, what is your preferred side?” “I’m right-handed”, Harry answered. “No problem, you will learn it!” Susanne gave him a reassuring smile.
After 20 minutes, the therapist had set up the electrodes and a stimulation program for muscle training. “You will use this device five times a week. Your brother will help you.” With a satisfying feeling, Harry watched his fingers artificially moved during the training program.
At home, the long-awaited moment has finally come. Susanne, the occupational therapist, arrived just a minute ago. She again brought the headset, and also a glove-like apparaturs for his arm and hand. “This is your individual neuroprosthesis”, Susanne announced. With the headset on his head, Harry can now learn to control the device. “We have to go through several steps. First, you can only trigger simple finger movements, but later on you will be able to use this for full finger and arm control”, Susanne explained.
This was half a year ago. With MoreGrasp, Harry takes the wooden spoon and stirs the spaghetti sauce he has cooked. “Only five more minutes to go”, he smiles. Although he still needs help, he is now able to perform manipulations with different tools such as spoons or knives. Most importantly for Harry, he is able to cook for his friends again. In addition, he has returned to work as a construction engineer. He is not able to visit construction sites any more, but he can work on his computer with an eye tracker and a head mouse, and use one hand/arm for difficult commands using a conventional computer mouse.","end user focused, honest and sustainable research",Research that only focuses on publications that overestimates results and is biased.

This page synthesizes the definition of DiDIY from which the Project starts and its objectives, as well as the Project Partners and roadmap.

Definition of DiDIY
Digital Do-It-Yourself (DiDIY) is a new socio-technological phenomenon which stems from the widespread availability of digital devices that support the convergence of physical (“atoms”) and informational (“bits”) components (ABC), as well as the growing accessibility of related knowledge and data through open online communities. This can lead to the emergence of new scenarios in the roles and relations among individuals, organizations, and society, in which the distinction between users and producers of physical artefacts is blurred, and new opportunities and threats emerge accordingly.

DiDIY-related technologies and social practices enable the low cost prototyping and manufacturing of physical artefacts from digital specifications. These tools and practices are emerging as effective amplifiers for the creativity and the skills of individuals, who can affordably develop “digitally self-made” objects, including such diverse options as extreme customization (“unique-by-design” objects) and context-aware, networked interactivity (“smart” objects that can sense and respond to their environments).

Objectives of the DiDIY project
The Project intends to develop a human-centric and multi-perspective approach to the scientific study of Digital DIY, in order to:
better understand its impacts on all areas of society
support both education and policy making on Digital DIY, through models and guidelines driven by social and cultural strategies, not technology",Unbiassed Aware Attentive,Research that is unaware or not attentive to possible harmful consequences,"Be aware of side (harmful)  effects, social effects, regulations that may be needed ","Checklist, Guidelines"

Smart systems, in which sophisticated software/hardware is embedded in physical systems, are part of everyday life. From simple products with embedded decision making software to massive systems in which hundreds of systems (each with hundreds or thousands of embedded processors) interoperate, the growth of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is likely to further accelerate. For Europe to benefit from this expansion, while avoiding the pitfalls that such complexity creates, there must be advances in the modelling and simulation (M&S) of CPS. Collaborative research with the US will be an opportunity to advance European M&S capabilities for CPS.

Thus, the overall aim of the EU co-funded TAMS4CPS-project is to lay the foundations for concrete EU-US collaboration in modelling and simulation for CPS. To achieve this, project partners from Loughborough and Newcastle Universities (UK, experts in the field of M&S for CPS) and Steinbeis-Europa-Zentrum (Germany, roadmapping expert) work with leading researchers in the field at top US universities to create:

A Strategic Research Agenda for Collaboration (SRAC), based on a comprehensive roadmapping process and endorsed by researchers in the EU and US,
A set of openly available test cases for model developers to perform collaborative evaluation,
A state of the art web-based report on M&S for CPS to provide the context for the SRAC and to act as a baseline for future collaborative research activities.
Taking a consultative approach, the project partners engage industry and academic researchers and M&S users in a series of workshops and web-based meetings to prioritise M&S research challenges and to create a constituency of future collaboration for pre-competitive research. All activities aim for a comprehensive implementation of the SRAC in a trans-national context ultimately benefitting both US and EU competitiveness.

The project directly addresses European priorities in CPS as the focus is on the following themes, which were elaborated by ARTEMIS, the European Industry Association in Embedded & Cyber-Physical Systems:

Architectures principles and models for autonomous safe secure Cyber-Physical Systems,
Systems design, modelling and virtual engineering for Cyber-Physical Systems,
Real time modelling for autonomous adaptive and cooperative Cyber-Physical Systems,
MBSE applied to computing platforms and energy management for Cyber-Physical Systems,
To these is added the exploitation and enabling theme of: Integration of socio/legal/governance models within modelling frameworks.
Professional in modelling and simulation for the above mentioned themes are welcome to join the project, to share knowledge and to become a member of the TAMS4CPS Expert Group.","Professionalism, integrity, respect","Irresponsible research ignores ethics, human rights and diversity and disregards community based participatory research principles.

The project aims to carry out strategic action for future CPS through roadmaps, impact multiplications and constituency building. In Road2CPS, coordinated by Steinbeis-Europa-Zentrum, 7 partners from 4 European countries (France, Germany, Spain and UK) dedicated themselves to:

- identifying the gaps of current research and bridging the efforts,
- analysing future research priorities and business opportunities and, 
- bringing the relevant stakeholders together to facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations between them. 


Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) find their application in many highly relevant areas to our society: multi-modal transport, health, smart factories, smart grids and smart cities among others. The inherent complexity of CPSs (and related complexity management), as well as the need to meet optimised performance and comply with essential requirements like safety, privacy, security, raises many questions that are already beginning to be explored by the research community. Road2CPS aims at accelerating uptake and implementation of these efforts.

As a result, the affected individuals are marginalized and unable to keep up with the rest of the society in a digitized world.

MAMEM’s goal is to integrate these people back into society by increasing their potential for communication and exchange in leisure (e.g. social networks) and non-leisure context (e.g. workplace). In this direction, MAMEM delivers the technology to enable interface channels that can be controlled through eye-movements and mental commands. This is accomplished by extending the core API of current operating systems with advanced function calls, appropriate for accessing the signals captured by an eye-tracker, an EEG-recorder and bio-measurement sensors. Then, pattern recognition and tracking algorithms are employed to jointly translate these signals into meaningful control and enable a set of novel paradigms for multimodal interaction. These paradigms will allow for low- (e.g., move a mouse), meso- (e.g., tick a box) and high-level (e.g., select n-out-of-m items) control of interface applications through eyes and mind. A set of persuasive design principles together with profiles modeling the users (dis-)abilities will be also employed for designing adapted interfaces for disabled. MAMEM will engage three different cohorts of disabled (i.e. Parkinson’s disease, neuromuscular disease, and tetraplegia) that will be asked to test a set of prototype applications dealing with multimedia authoring and management.

MAMEM’s final objective is to assess the impact of this technology in making these people more socially integrated by, for instance, becoming more active in sharing content through social networks and communicating with their friends and family.","Ethics, Marginalized, Society","Research that does not pay attention to ethical issues and treats research subjects without the necessary sensitivity (i.e. stigmatization, inform consent, incidental findings, etc).

This is not free of challenges. Especially in the case of care, migrants, often face a double challenge: (i) not to speak the language and not to be acquainted with the culture of the resident country, and (ii) be unfamiliar with the care and health administrations of the country. As a consequence, e.g., elderly migrants in care homes suffer from social exclusion, with their relatives also struggling with getting the right information and interacting with the administration, migrants at home are often reluctant to go to see the doctor in case of health issues, a tendency that is often further aggravated by cultural matters. Migrant temporary care workers, who in addition often do not have an adequate professional training, face the problem of isolation, lack of professional background information and deficient communication with both the cared and the supervision personnel.

There is wide agreement that responsible research and innovation is desirable, especially in the wake of the ongoing financial crisis precipitated by the 2007/08 economic crash. Responsibility for innovative practices, of actors involved in innovation and between innovators, policymakers and the wider public are all facets of this broad desire. Responsibility forms a central part of participative research and innovation governance. It can increase the legitimacy of findings and heighten public awareness and discourse as well as making sustainable economic benefits. As a consequence there are numerous attempts to stimulate reflection upon and research into responsible practices and to embed the concepts in research and innovation governance.

Problem

Despite the many activities to stimulate and implement responsible research and innovation, there is currently no agreement on how to evaluate what it means. This is partly caused by conceptual problems, as key terms are contested. There is disagreement on what counts as responsibility, on the role and definition of the actors involved and on the way in which governance can promote, foster or judge the presence of responsibility in research and innovation practice. The theoretical benefits and disadvantages of responsible research and innovation are disputed and there is a lack of empirical evidence of the effect of the integration of responsible practices here. Briefly, there is currently no mechanism or procedure that will allow for evidence-based planning, implementing and evaluating responsible research and innovation.

Aims

The GREAT project addresses the call of SiS.2012.1.1.1-1: Governance frameworks for Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), Area 5.1.1.1 Relationships between science, democracy and law, Activity 5.1.1. Better understanding of the place of science and technology (S&T) in society, Action Line 1: A more dynamic governance of the science and society relationship

The GREAT project will develop an empirically based and theoretically sound model of the role of responsible research and innovation governance. The project will explore the dynamics of participation in research and innovation, and investigate the characteristics of responsible practices. It will investigate the nature of new partnerships among various stakeholders, researchers and policymakers that are developing within innovation networks and the influence that these developments have on knowledge production and policy. This will be done by:

determining the characteristics of research and innovation
involving diverse groupings and
determining the social processes involved in responsible research and innovation practices.
In doing so, the GREAT project will address all three issues requested in the call:

It will explore the knowledge and research potential of multi-stakeholder approaches in research;
it will investigate how responsible innovation is involved in research processes and
it will use this knowledge to inform policy makers on how to integrate responsible innovation in further research activities.
Approach

The GREAT project will investigate current practices in responsible research and innovation and develop a sound theoretical approach to analyse, compare, evaluate and improve these practices. Every other approach to RRI involves taking a position and working out the consequences of that prior decision, regardless of emergent conditions. GREAT’s novelty lies in not being tied to a predetermined approach, but to developing a procedure adaptable to novel scenarios. Based on a grid of analysis, the project will identify collaborative arrangements involving both, responsible research and innovation, and analyse them to identify and understand the characteristics, influencing factors and best practice of responsible research and innovation in a normative way, permitting planning, implementation and assessment of RRI in novel and unforeseen circumstances.

GREAT will do a survey on particular CIP projects of the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme projects and choose some examples for in-depth case studies guided by previous GREAT partners’ contacts from ETICA and EGAIS in the pool of these projects.

To gain a detailed understanding of various means of responsible research and innovation, the analysis of practices in the CIP projects will provide practical examples and references for researchers to analyse and develop critical insights into responsible research and innovation.

In addition GREAT will test and develop the approach continuously with ongoing projects to assure that (theoretical) development of any framework is attached closely to the current landscape of research and development practice. Presumably, a single model that would fit for all kinds of research and innovation activity is not possible to achieve. For this reason a ‘reality check’ can be offered by partners’ own various technology development projects as a test-bed for framework.

Starting from the grid of analysis, a model of responsible research and innovation will be developed from structured analysis of a pool of case studies. This model will represent the relationships and causal effects of factors influencing responsible research and innovation. It will allow for comparative analysis of crucial success factors of responsible research and innovation. Such factors will include characteristics of responsible researchers, the aims of employing ‘responsibility’ as a modus operandi in innovative research practice (and that research aimed at producing innovative outcomes), the nature of the research or the governance structure of the project. The model will be developed in constant iteration of theoretical and empirical findings to avoid the development of blind spots in research design or theoretical framing. Survey and case studies will be used to develop it and it will be validated using independent evaluators and cases. No such model currently exists which renders it difficult to plan, implement and evaluate responsible research and innovation. The GREAT consortium is uniquely placed to create the model because of its theoretical and empirical experience of participative approaches and its involvement in the development of similar models in other domains (e.g. ethical governance of emerging technologies in the ETICA and EGAIS projects) and its close affinity to end users of the model (e.g. research organisations, CSOs, research and innovation policy makers).

As a proof-of-concept for the grid of analysis and the developed conceptual model, an agent-based model (ABM) developed in a tender study for DG INFSO (INFSO-SKIN) will be adopted to implement the findings. INFSO-SKIN is a tool for ex-ante evaluation of research and innovation networks (it simulates scenarios for collaborative research and innovation networks under various policy conditions using real-world-data). The ABM will be extended by the categories suggested in GREAT, e.g. implementing civil society agents, implementing certain preferences and needs of stakeholders etc.",ethically acceptability social desirability interactivity," RRI  is an ‘umbrella term’ characterized by: involving ethical and social issues more directly in the innovation process by integrative approaches to development and innovation

giving new shape to innovation processes and to technology governance according to responsibility reflections in all of its three dimensions [governance, moral and epistemic] […]
in particular, making the distribution of responsibility among the involved actors as transparent as possible
supporting “constructive paths” of co-evolution of technology and the regulatory frameworks of society’
Rather than defining RRI, this characterization explains what RRI aims to do and how these aims should be attained. Why that is the case is not covered in the definition. Similar to the other accounts discussed above, the importance of addressing ethical and social issues in the R&I process is central (WHAT).
","There is wide agreement that responsible research and innovation is desirable, especially in the wake of the ongoing financial crisis precipitated by the 2007/08 economic crash. Responsibility for innovative practices, of actors involved in innovation and between innovators, policymakers and the wider public are all facets of this broad desire. Responsibility forms a central part of participative research and innovation governance. It can increase the legitimacy of findings and heighten public awareness and discourse as well as making sustainable economic benefits. As a consequence there are numerous attempts to stimulate reflection upon and research into responsible practices and to embed the concepts in research and innovation governance.
Problem

Despite the many activities to stimulate and implement responsible research and innovation, there is currently no agreement on how to evaluate what it means. This is partly caused by conceptual problems, as key terms are contested. There is disagreement on what counts as responsibility, on the role and definition of the actors involved and on the way in which governance can promote, foster or judge the presence of responsibility in research and innovation practice. The theoretical benefits and disadvantages of responsible research and innovation are disputed and there is a lack of empirical evidence of the effect of the integration of responsible practices here. Briefly, there is currently no mechanism or procedure that will allow for evidence-based planning, implementing and evaluating responsible research and innovation.

Aims

The GREAT project addresses the call of SiS.2012.1.1.1-1: Governance frameworks for Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), Area 5.1.1.1 Relationships between science, democracy and law, Activity 5.1.1. Better understanding of the place of science and technology (S&T) in society, Action Line 1: A more dynamic governance of the science and society relationship

The GREAT project will develop an empirically based and theoretically sound model of the role of responsible research and innovation governance. The project will explore the dynamics of participation in research and innovation, and investigate the characteristics of responsible practices. It will investigate the nature of new partnerships among various stakeholders, researchers and policymakers that are developing within innovation networks and the influence that these developments have on knowledge production and policy. This will be done by:

    determining the characteristics of research and innovation
    involving diverse groupings and
    determining the social processes involved in responsible research and innovation practices.

In doing so, the GREAT project will address all three issues requested in the call:

    It will explore the knowledge and research potential of multi-stakeholder approaches in research;
    it will investigate how responsible innovation is involved in research processes and
    it will use this knowledge to inform policy makers on how to integrate responsible innovation in further research activities.

Approach

The GREAT project will investigate current practices in responsible research and innovation and develop a sound theoretical approach to analyse, compare, evaluate and improve these practices. Every other approach to RRI involves taking a position and working out the consequences of that prior decision, regardless of emergent conditions. GREAT’s novelty lies in not being tied to a predetermined approach, but to developing a procedure adaptable to novel scenarios. Based on a grid of analysis, the project will identify collaborative arrangements involving both, responsible research and innovation, and analyse them to identify and understand the characteristics, influencing factors and best practice of responsible research and innovation in a normative way, permitting planning, implementation and assessment of RRI in novel and unforeseen circumstances.

GREAT will do a survey on particular CIP projects of the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme projects and choose some examples for in-depth case studies guided by previous GREAT partners’ contacts from ETICA and EGAIS in the pool of these projects.

To gain a detailed understanding of various means of responsible research and innovation, the analysis of practices in the CIP projects will provide practical examples and references for researchers to analyse and develop critical insights into responsible research and innovation.

In addition GREAT will test and develop the approach continuously with ongoing projects to assure that (theoretical) development of any framework is attached closely to the current landscape of research and development practice. Presumably, a single model that would fit for all kinds of research and innovation activity is not possible to achieve. For this reason a ‘reality check’ can be offered by partners’ own various technology development projects as a test-bed for framework.

Starting from the grid of analysis, a model of responsible research and innovation will be developed from structured analysis of a pool of case studies. This model will represent the relationships and causal effects of factors influencing responsible research and innovation. It will allow for comparative analysis of crucial success factors of responsible research and innovation. Such factors will include characteristics of responsible researchers, the aims of employing ‘responsibility’ as a modus operandi in innovative research practice (and that research aimed at producing innovative outcomes), the nature of the research or the governance structure of the project. The model will be developed in constant iteration of theoretical and empirical findings to avoid the development of blind spots in research design or theoretical framing. Survey and case studies will be used to develop it and it will be validated using independent evaluators and cases. No such model currently exists which renders it difficult to plan, implement and evaluate responsible research and innovation. The GREAT consortium is uniquely placed to create the model because of its theoretical and empirical experience of participative approaches and its involvement in the development of similar models in other domains (e.g. ethical governance of emerging technologies in the ETICA and EGAIS projects) and its close affinity to end users of the model (e.g. research organisations, CSOs, research and innovation policy makers).

As a proof-of-concept for the grid of analysis and the developed conceptual model, an agent-based model (ABM) developed in a tender study for DG INFSO (INFSO-SKIN) will be adopted to implement the findings. INFSO-SKIN is a tool for ex-ante evaluation of research and innovation networks (it simulates scenarios for collaborative research and innovation networks under various policy conditions using real-world-data). The ABM will be extended by the categories suggested in GREAT, e.g. implementing civil society agents, implementing certain preferences and needs of stakeholders etc.
RRI is a governance framework
It is not exclusively based on top-down or legislative mechanisms for research and innovation policy
It uses transparency, stakeholder involvement and public engagement to achieve social desirability/acceptability
RRI is an overarching framework that integrates and adds to existing tools to create a more thorough and flexible approach to governance
